    Establishes and caches a connection to Snowflake.
    This function uses Streamlit's @st.cache_resource decorator to cache the 
    Snowflake connection so that:
    
    1. The connection is created only once and reused across multiple 
       reruns of the Streamlit app.
    2. The same connection object is shared across all users of the app.
    3. The connection persists until the Streamlit server is stopped or 
       the cache is cleared.
